      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of them is definitely my time management skills. i have never been
        this busy before. I am working four days a week, studying for a master's
        degree and studying for this certificate in applied software
        development. On top of those, I try to keep myself active outside work
        and study, so I take weekly salsa dance sessions and tennis sessions. I
        have been busy but I am enjoying all of these. The second one would be
        that I have progressed a lot. I didn't realise it until I passed a
        technical assessment from a graduate program I applied for. I am really
        proud of myself. Third thing is I can't believe how easily distracted I
        am sometimes. If I want to concertrate on something, I have to leave my
        phone far away from me. Otherwise I always end up with scrolling on my
        phone for nothing.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think it is of vital importance, as this is about how to view
        challenges in the process of programming. I learned it long time ago
        that a big part of programming is testing and dubugging. No one can
        guarantee that all the codes they write at the first time work
        staightaway.
      </p>

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't know the term neuroplasticity, and it is good to develop a
        better understanding of it.
      </p>

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing really. I learned most of it in my previous work experience.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because in a real project in the real world, it is collaboration that
        matters. There will be teamwork where effective listening is needed.
        Besides, growth mindset is significant as tech itself is developing in a
        fast pace nowadays, especially with AI. Developers need to get their
        growth mindset ready, which is why I hope to be a developer as it feels
        great to always learn new stuff.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I don't feel that way. Core learning is actually the key to future
        growth from my perspective, because in the real case there is
        communication and more needed working in the team.
