    <h2>Explain the relationship between JavaScript and HTML and CSS. </h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript can respond to user interactions and other events triggered by the browser, such as clicks, mouse movements, form submissions and more. </br> HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS is used to style and format the elements defined in HTML. JavaScript can manipulate both HTML and CSS to dynamically change their structure and appearance based on user actions or other events. They work together to create modern web applications with rich functionality, dynamic content, and engaging user interfaces. 
    </p>

    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h2>
    <p>
      Control flow refers to the order in which instructions or actions are executed in a program or process. In cooking dinner, control flow determines the sequence of steps people follow to prepare and cook the meal. <br> Loops allow people to repeat a set of instructions multiple times until a certain condition is met. In cooking dinner, loops could represent repetitive tasks such as stirring a pot, checking the doneness of food, or adding seasoning gradually.
    </p>

    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is like the behind-the-scenes framework that enables websites to be dynamic and interactive. When you click on a button or fill out a form on a web page, it's the DOM that's working behind the scenes to make things happen, just like how the blueprint of a house guides the construction and arrangement of furniture. <br> people can respond to user actions such as clicks, key presses, mouse movements, and form submissions by attaching event listeners to DOM elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are ordered collections of data, where each element is identified by its index, starting from 0. Arrays are ideal for storing lists of similar items, such as a list of numbers, strings, or objects.<br> Objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key. Objects are ideal for representing entities with named attributes, such as a person with properties like name, age, and email.
    </p>
  

    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are like recipes in a cookbook. Just like a recipe tells you how to make a dish step by step, a function is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or calculation. <br> People can use a function to perform the same task in different parts of a program without having to rewrite the instructions each time. Functions help organize code by grouping related instructions together, making it easier to understand and manage.
